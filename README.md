# haiku-themes-linux
Various 'Haiku' clone/very inspired/ripped themes & assets from across the internet. These were somewhat hard to find, very scattered, so I'll collect all I can here. Makes your Linux more Haiku-ish. Some may be obsolete. Used without permission.

I recommend using these files with and in the Xfce4 (Xfce) desktop, it seems to fit and look the best there, in my opinion.

If you own content mirrored in this repo, and wish for the content to be removed, please contact me at TheNovimatrem@protonmail.ch specifying which files, with proof of ownership, and it will be taken care of within 18 hours.
