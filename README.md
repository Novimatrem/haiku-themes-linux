# haiku-themes-linux
Various 'Haiku' clone/very inspired/ripped themes & assets from across the internet. These were somewhat hard to find, very scattered, so I'll collect all I can here. Makes your Linux more Haiku-ish. Some may be obsolete. Used without permission.

I recommend using these files with and in the Xfce4 (Xfce) desktop, it seems to fit and look the best there, in my opinion- but they of course will work with almost every DE/WM.

# Screenshot of result
After applying and using these files, your system will look like the following, or very close to it :)
